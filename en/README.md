## What is the Data Career Guide?

It is a free project of a guide (not a book or a course) to careers that work with data, inspired by [Learn to cloud](https://learntocloud.guide). The object is to supply the needed content to development of skills that are commonly used in data careers. In the end we want to have content about the careers of:

- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Analytics Engineer/Developer
